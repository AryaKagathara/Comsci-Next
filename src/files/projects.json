Leveraging powerful mapping technologies such as Google Maps API, OpenStreetMap, and LeafletJS, the system calculates the most efficient route based on user-defined constraints (like cost or time). It then automatically generates precise quotes and comprehensive reports, transforming formerly manual tasks into a fast, accurate, and data-driven workflow essential for effective logistics decision-making."

The frontend was built with ReactJS to provide a dynamic and intuitive user interface, planned through Figma and Photoshop. The backend logic, handling complex calculations and data interactions, is powered by Java with Spring Boot and NodeJS, communicating via a REST API and supported by a SQL Database. The deep integration of various mapping libraries was foundational to the tool's GIS capabilities, enabling real-time data processing and advanced route visualization, making it an indispensable asset for logistics operations seeking reduced costs and improved delivery times."
