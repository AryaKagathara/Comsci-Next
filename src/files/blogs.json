(Functionality & UX):</strong> Apps can often provide a slicker, faster user experience because they are purpose-built for the device. They can leverage device features (camera, contacts, GPS, offline storage) and send push notifications (those little alerts that pop up). Think high-tech gadget. Modern Websites (especially 'responsive' ones that adapt to screen size) can offer great mobile experiences too, but might have limitations accessing all phone hardware features. Think reliable multi-tool."

Apps arguably need <em>more</em> intensive maintenance. You constantly need to adapt to new OS versions (iOS 17, Android 14, etc.), new device screen sizes, and changing app store rules, often requiring republishing. It's like maintaining specialized machinery that gets updated by external companies (Apple and Google)."

If you're just starting out, need broad reach, want to be easily discovered via search, and are working with a tighter budget, launching a solid, mobile-friendly Website is often the smartest first move. It’s your accessible digital home base. However, if your core business <em>is</em> a tool, a game, requires heavy use of phone features, or relies on frequent, specific interactions from a dedicated user base, investing in a Mobile App might be the right call from the get-go, possibly alongside a simpler informational website."
